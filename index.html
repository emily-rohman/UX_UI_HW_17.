        <p>Iâ€™m a design leader known for building thoughtful experiences in the digital and physical world we live in. 

            My past experiences have shaped the way I approach problem-solving complex public health issues (anything from adolescent mental health, orthopaedics, to pandemics). My goal is to make sustainable behavior changes in population health through the innovation and design of disruptive technology.</p>
